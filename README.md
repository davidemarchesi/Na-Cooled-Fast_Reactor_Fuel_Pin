# Na-Cooled-Fast_Reactor_Fuel_Pin
Preliminary design of a Sodium-cooled fast reactor fuel pin based on the published data of an ASTRID-like reactor.

A preliminary sizing is proposed based on the simulations about the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the fuel pin.

This project is under development, and will be periodically updated the results of the simulations.
