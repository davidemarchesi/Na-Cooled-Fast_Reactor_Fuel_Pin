# Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor' Fuel Pin 1-1/2 D Analysis
This project was developed during the last year of MSc. at 'Politecnico di Milano' for the 'Nuclear Design and Technology' course.

The goal of the project was to perform a complete thermo-mechanical 1-1/2 D analysis in order to design a fuel pin for a SFR similar to the ASTRID concept. After a complete evaluation of all the main processes involved, is proposed a set of possible parameters in order to respect physical constraints and regulations limits. These parameters are: gap size, cladding thickness and plenum volume.

The numerical simulations were made using the **Colab IDLE Python envinronment**.

The theoretical frame and the procedure followed for the code development, together with the results obtained, is here available in the attached paper.
